# Python Package Exercise

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Features
(PACKAGE NAME) is a Python package designed to make coding more fun with simple text transformations and feel-good messages. It includes four features: reversing text, converting words into leetspeak, generating random compliments for developers, and providing fun, coding-related fortunes. The reverse text function flips any string backward, while the leetspeak converter transforms text into a stylized hacker-style format. The developer compliments feature offers encouraging messages like "Your code is legendary" or "You're a debugging wizard," and the fortune function provides humorous and insightful messages inspired by fortune cookies. Whether used as a command-line tool or integrated into other applications, (PACKAGE NAME) adds a bit of positivity and entertainment to a developer's workflow.

a link to your package's page on the PyPI website.

how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation and code examples for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.

how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

the names of all teammates as links to their GitHub profiles in the README.md file.

instructions for how to configure and run all parts of your project for any developer on any platform - these instructions must work!

instructions for how to set up any environment variables and import any starter data into the database, as necessary, for the system to operate correctly when run.

if there are any "secret" configuration files, such as .env or similar files, that are not included in the version control repository, examples of these files, such as env.example, with dummy data must be included in the repository and exact instructions for how to create the proper configuration files and what their contents should be must be supplied to the course admins by the due date.
